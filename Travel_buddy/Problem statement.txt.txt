That's an excellent and very practical angle to consider for a unique problem statement! Focusing on budget and cost-effectiveness, particularly by leveraging open-source alternatives, can definitely differentiate your Online Travel Agency. Here's a problem statement incorporating that aspect:

Option 5: The "Budget-Conscious and Transparent Travel Planning with Open-Source Mapping" Problem

Existing Online Travel Agencies often incur significant costs associated with proprietary mapping services, which can indirectly influence pricing and limit the ability to offer truly budget-friendly travel options. Furthermore, the reliance on closed-source mapping solutions can restrict customization and the integration of specific, cost-effective features relevant to budget travelers. This leads to a gap in the market for a transparent and cost-conscious OTA that leverages open-source mapping solutions like Leaflet to provide affordable and tailored travel planning for budget-sensitive users.

Why this is unique:

Directly Addresses Cost: It explicitly tackles the cost implications of using proprietary services like Google Maps and positions the solution as a more budget-friendly alternative.
Focus on Budget Travelers: It clearly targets a specific user segment – those who are highly price-sensitive.
Highlights Transparency: The mention of transparency suggests that the cost savings from using open-source solutions could be passed on to the users.
Leverages Open-Source: Specifically mentioning Leaflet (or similar open-source tools) showcases a concrete technical differentiator and a commitment to cost-effectiveness.   
Potential for Customization: It hints at the benefits of open-source in allowing for more tailored features that might not be available or cost-effective with proprietary solutions.
Potential Solution Direction: An OTA that:

Primarily uses Leaflet or other open-source mapping libraries.
Explicitly highlights cost savings for users.
Potentially offers features specifically beneficial for budget travelers (e.g., free walking tours integration, hostel recommendations, public transport focus).
Might allow for more customization of the map interface to highlight budget-friendly points of interest.
Why this is a strong angle for a unique problem statement:

Real-world Constraint: Budget is a primary concern for a large segment of travelers.
Practical Implementation: Using Leaflet is a tangible technical decision that directly addresses the cost issue.
Potential for Differentiation: Many OTAs heavily rely on Google Maps, making this a clear point of divergence.
Sustainability (Indirectly): Open-source often aligns with principles of accessibility and community-driven development, which can resonate with some users.   
To further strengthen this problem statement, you could consider adding a specific pain point that budget travelers currently face due to the limitations of existing OTAs' mapping integrations. For example:

"...This leads to a gap in the market for a transparent and cost-conscious OTA that leverages open-source mapping solutions like Leaflet to provide affordable and tailored travel planning for budget-sensitive users, who often struggle to find detailed information on free or low-cost local attractions and transportation options that are not prominently featured on standard, commercially-driven mapping platforms."

This addition makes the problem even more specific and highlights a direct benefit of using a more customizable, open-source mapping solution.

By focusing on the budget aspect and the strategic use of open-source technologies, you can create a compelling and unique problem statement for your Online Travel Agency project. Good luck with your lecturer!

Does renting the wrong car for a certain terrain and having to rent the right one actually happen in real life


Yes, renting the wrong car for a certain terrain and subsequently needing to rent a second, more suitable vehicle absolutely happens in real life. Here are some common scenarios and reasons why:

Scenarios Where Renting the Wrong Car Occurs:

Unforeseen Weather Changes: A traveler might rent a standard sedan for a trip, only to find that heavy rains have caused flooding or turned unpaved roads into muddy tracks, making the sedan unsuitable and potentially dangerous.
Lack of Awareness of Terrain: Tourists unfamiliar with a region might underestimate the challenging terrain (e.g., steep gravel roads, unmaintained paths) and rent a vehicle with insufficient ground clearance or traction (like a small car).
Misleading Information: Sometimes, rental car descriptions or online information might not accurately reflect the conditions of the roads the traveler intends to use.
Budget Constraints Initially: A traveler on a tight budget might opt for the cheapest available car, only to realize later that it cannot handle the terrain required for their planned activities (e.g., accessing a remote hiking trail).
Seasonal Changes: Renting a car during the dry season might seem fine, but the same vehicle could be entirely inappropriate during the rainy or snowy season due to traction issues.
Limited Availability: In some locations, especially during peak season, the desired type of vehicle (like a 4x4) might not be available at the time of booking, leading travelers to settle for something less suitable initially.
Consequences of Renting the Wrong Car:

Getting Stuck: The most obvious issue is the car getting stuck in mud, sand, or snow, requiring towing and causing significant delays and expenses.
Vehicle Damage: Driving an unsuitable car on rough terrain can lead to damage to the undercarriage, tires, or suspension, potentially incurring hefty repair fees from the rental company.
Safety Risks: Using a vehicle not designed for the terrain can compromise safety, especially on steep or slippery roads.
Inability to Reach Destinations: Renting the wrong car can prevent travelers from accessing planned attractions or accommodations located on challenging roads.
Increased Costs: Having to rent a second, more appropriate vehicle obviously doubles the transportation expenses.
Real-Life Examples (Based on General Knowledge and Logical Scenarios):

A family rents a minivan for a scenic coastal drive, unaware that a significant portion of the route involves unpaved, rocky roads that the minivan cannot handle. They might have to turn back and rent an SUV with higher clearance.
A couple rents a fuel-efficient compact car for exploring a mountainous region, only to find that the steep inclines and loose gravel roads require a vehicle with more power and better traction, leading them to upgrade to an all-wheel-drive vehicle.
Tourists in a tropical area rent a standard car, but unexpected heavy rains cause widespread flooding, making it necessary to rent a vehicle with higher ground clearance to navigate flooded roads.
While specific documented cases of someone explicitly having to rent two cars due to terrain issues might be harder to find in a quick search, the scenarios leading to the need for a more suitable car after realizing the first one is inadequate are definitely common. Travelers often share their experiences on travel forums about underestimating road conditions or regretting their initial vehicle choice.

Therefore, your problem statement about proactively addressing this issue through weather and terrain-aware recommendations is highly relevant and based on a real-world problem.
